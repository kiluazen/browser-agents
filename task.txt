1. Open blinkit
2. It's most possible that you are already logged in. IF NOT!! Do the following

    1.  FIRST: IF a popup for address appears query load_login_details.
    2.  IF you are not logged in, figure out a way to get to the login page and use load_login_details for email/phone, Enter the email or phone number and wait for me to finish the auth task (OTP etc)

3. PRODUCT SEARCH WORKFLOW - FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY:

   STEP 1: For each item in items.txt, FIRST call refine_product_search to get precise search terms
   STEP 2: Use the refined search term (not the original description) to search in zepto
   STEP 3: Before adding ANY product to cart, call validate_product_selection to confirm it matches
   STEP 4: Only add to cart if validation returns ACCEPT

4. CRITICAL SHOPPING RULES:

   ❌ BRAND SUBSTITUTION = NEVER ALLOWED 
   - Pringles ≠ Lays ≠ Bingo (Different brands = REJECT)
   - SuperYou ≠ ProteinX ≠ any other brand (Must be exact brand match)
   - OpenSecret ≠ Sunfeast ≠ Britannia (Brand must match exactly)

   ✅ ACCEPTABLE VARIATIONS:
   - Size variations: 50g vs 40g vs 60g (close sizes OK)
   - Flavor variations: Original vs Classic vs Plain (similar flavors OK)

   ❌ OUT OF STOCK HANDLING:
   - If exact brand is out of stock → DO NOT substitute with different brand
   - Skip the item and note "Item [X] unavailable - exact brand not in stock"
   - Continue with remaining items

5. ITEMS TO ORDER:
   
   FIRST: Call load_items() to get the current shopping list from items.txt
   THEN: Process each item using the workflow above.

   IMPORTANT: Each item will be processed as:
   1. Call refine_product_search with the item description
   2. Search using the refined term
   3. Before adding to cart, call validate_product_selection  
   4. Only proceed if validation says ACCEPT
   5. If validation says REJECT → SKIP item and continue with next

6. After you have added all VALIDATED items, go to the checkout cart section and cross check:
   - Remove any items that are NOT from our list
   - Verify each item matches our brand requirements
   - Confirm quantities are correct

7. Make sure the address is 'Get Crux' - this will be part of a list of saved addresses you can find in the checkout page.

8. Click on payment, and let me complete the payment manually. After I press Enter, continue and confirm the order is placed successfully.
   - Payment method details are UPI, for upi_id please query load_login_details

REMEMBER: NO BRAND SUBSTITUTIONS. Better to skip an item than get the wrong brand!
